### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is **Sahin**, I am **Founder**, **Game Producer** and **Lead Unity Developer** of **DynamicBox**. We're a small indie studio, mostly dealing with work-for-hire work (we've got a couple internal projects up and coming :sunglasses:). **Unity** is the main engine we're using, so I'll try to share some of the tools we build out (along with stuff we've learnt from others from the community) in the process.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **Werewolf Heroes** - a social deduction multiplayer game, coming to iOS and Android
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m experimenting with **Unreal engine**, but way to go...
- ðŸ“« The best way to reach me is through **Twitter**. Hint: My username is the same there.
- ðŸ’¬ I've been experimenting with quite a lot of **latest Unity tech** (SRPs, Shader Graph, VFX Graph, DOTS, etc.), so (if the overloaded schedule allows) I'll be glad to show in the correct direction.
